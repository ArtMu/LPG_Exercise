# LPG_Exercise

Installing Test Framework
- Clone this GIT repo locally
- Do o root folder of this repo: npm install

Running Test - Suites:
- Test suites for API and UI tests can be launch on Cypress runner
- Cyppress runner can be started on command line using command: "npm run lpg:open:cypress"
- Clicking the test suite name, either lpApiTest.spec.js or lpUITest.spec.js on runner will run the suite

Notes:
- UI test: Happy - path test suite implemented for UI test: Historic Sightseeing Cruise - attraction until payment - stage.
- API test: all 3 API queries implemented for GET All Cities, All Attractions for NY and NY with only MUSEUM:s.
- Separated command line versions could be also implemented but my time was limited.
